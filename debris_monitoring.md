# ZTF J0139+5245

Below are the available photometric data for ZTF J0139+5245 from the [Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)](https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/) through **DR9** and from ongoing [Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO)](https://lco.global/) 1.0-meter observations. ZTF J0139+5245 is a white dwarf that was discovered to exhibit irregularly-shaped transit events caused by broken-up planetary material that recur on a roughly 104-day period ([Vanderbosch et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...897..171V/abstract)). If you would like access to the LCO data, please feel free to contact me at zvanderbosch@astro.as.utexas.edu

# New Debris Candidate

A newly discovered system exihibiting dips similar those seen in ZTF J0139+5245, but recurring on a slightly longer timescale of about 180-190 days. Currently investigating the nature of this object, but providing the ZTF and LCO data here for those interested in monitorig the dip events. The midpoint of the next dip is expected around March 22nd.
