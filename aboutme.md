I'm an Astronomy Ph.D. student at the Univeristy of Texas at Austin studying pulsating helium-atmosphere white dwarf stars. I work on the discovery of these objects and the collection and analysis of their spectra using the 2.1-meter Otto Struve Telescope and the 10-meter Hobby Eberly Telescope (HET) at [McDonald Observatory](http://mcdonaldobservatory.org/).  My goal is to provide stronger empirical constraints on the range of temperatures over which we observe pulsations in these objects so we can better compare the observational limits with theoretical models. I'm also very interested in working with the data produced by current and forthcoming large scale time-domain surveys such as the [Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)](https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/) and the [Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)](https://www.lsst.org/).  In particular, I'm interested in using their [real-time transient alerts](https://mars.lco.global/) to identify transient and periodic variability among the population of white dwarf stars.

In addition to astronomy, I greatly enjoy spending time outdoors, either rock climbing, playing ultimate frisbee, or just walking around in the woods.  I also enjoy developing software tools with Python for the reduction, analysis, and visualization of astronomical data.
