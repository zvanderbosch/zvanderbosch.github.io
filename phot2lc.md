subtitle: A pure-Python Light Curve Extraction Suite
---

**phot2lc is a pure-Python interactive tool for extracting light curves from time-series photometric data.** 

**phot2lc** is largely inspired by WQED ([Thompson & Mullally 2009](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009JPhCS.172a2081T/abstract), [2013](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ascl.soft04004T/abstract)), and is designed to work with the output photometry from both MAESTRO ([Dalessio 2010](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AAS...21545209D/abstract), [2013](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013PhDT.......170D/abstract)) and ccd_hsp ([Kanaan et al. 2002](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002A%26A...389..896K/abstract)).

While not nearly as extensive in its scope as WQED, **phot2lc** has several key features which make it a much more efficient and user-friendly tool for light curve extraction. The first such feature is its ease of installation. **phot2lc** is a python package and can be installed with:

    pip install phot2lc
