## My Website

This is the source code for [my personal website](http://zvanderbosch.github.io) where I share things related to my research and projects along with other general interests. I made this website using the **Beautiful Jekyll** template created by Dean Attali.  If you like this website design, you can [check out other demos](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll) or visit [Dean Attali's personal website](https://deanattali.com) to see it in action and get more examples of how to use it along with the template itself.
