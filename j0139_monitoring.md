title: ZTF J0139+5245 
subtitle: Photometric Monitoring from the ZTF and LCOGT
---

Below are the available photometric data for ZTF J0139+5245 from the [Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)](https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/) through DR4 and from ongoing [Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO)](https://lco.global/) 1.0-meter observations. ZTF J0139+5245 is a white dwarf that was discovered to exhibit irregularly-shaped transit events caused by broken-up planetary material that recur on a roughly 100-day period ([Vanderbosch et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...897..171V/abstract)). The exact timing of a transit is unpredictable, as transits have been observed with spacings anywhere from 90 to 110 days. While ZTF public data releases occur only once every six months, the LCO monitoring provides near real-time information about whether a transit has begun. We provide the updated LCO data here for anybody who wishes to observe this object.
