title: ZTF J0139+5245 
subtitle: Photometric Monitoring from the ZTF and LCOGT
---

Below are the available photometric data for ZTF J0139+5245 from the [Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)](https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/) through DR3 and from ongoing [Las Cumbres Observatory (LCOGT)](https://lco.global/) 1.0-meter observations.  This object is a white dwarf that was discovered to exhibit irregularly-shaped transit events in its ZTF data ([Vanderbosch et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...897..171V/abstract)) and is being monitored now for similar events. ZTF public data releases only once every six months, while the LCOGT monitoring provides near real-time monitoring allowing quick photometric and spectroscopic follow up if a transit event is detected.
