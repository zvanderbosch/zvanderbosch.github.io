Below are the available photometric data for ZTF J0139+5245 from the [Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)](https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/) through DR1 and from ongoing [Las Cumbres Observatory (LCOGT)](https://lco.global/) 1.0-meter observations.  This object is a white dwarf that was discovered to exhibit irregularly-shaped transit events in its ZTF data ([Vanderbosch et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190809839V/abstract)) and is being monitored now for similar events. ZTF public data releases occur once every six months, the next set to occur in early November.
